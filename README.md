This repository presents an end-to-end analysis of LinkedIn's professional networking platform's Jobs section. The project aims to extract over 500 job details from LinkedIn's website using the Python library, Selenium, and organize the information into specific formats by creating three tables. Additionally, the project involved data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Numpy libraries. MySQL and MS-Excel were utilized to derive insights from the dataset. Power BI was used to visualize the results. Finally, a web page was created to present relevant job information based on the skills listed in the dataset. The page was hosted on the cloud for wider access.

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

 2. Did the data cleaning and EDA part with the help of Pandas and imported the CSVs into MySQL for furthur analysis.

3. Took help of different SQL clauses like group by, order by, having etc in order to manupalate the data and get the insights out.
