This repository presents an end-to-end analysis of LinkedIn's professional networking platform's Jobs section. The project aims to extract over 500 job details from LinkedIn's website using the Python library, Selenium, and organize the information into specific formats by creating three tables. Additionally, the project involved data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Numpy libraries. MySQL and MS-Excel were utilized to derive insights from the dataset. Power BI was used to visualize the results. Finally, a web page was created to present relevant job information based on the skills listed in the dataset. The page was hosted on the cloud for wider access.

  1. Implemented web scraping on the LinkedIn jobs section using the Python library Selenium. Leveraged its capabilities to extract and retrieve the following attributes from the job listings:


| Attribute | Feature's Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|
|`location` | The location of the job |
|`designation`| The designation of the job |
|`name`| Name of the company |
|`industry` | Industry in which the company operates |
|`employees_count`| Count of employees |
|`linkedin_followers` | Number of followers on linkedin |
|`involvement` | the nature of involvement in the job, for instance: Full-time, part-time |
|`level` | The seniority level like Mid-Senior level |
|`total_applicants` | total number of applicants |
		

  2. Utilized Pandas to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and seamlessly imported the CSV files into MySQL for comprehensive analysis and further insights extraction.

3. Skillfully employed various SQL clauses such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and more to manipulate the data, enabling in-depth analysis and extraction of valuable insights.
